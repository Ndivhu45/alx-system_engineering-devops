Outage Postmortem: Web Stack Debugging Project

Issue Summary:

Duration:
Start Time: February 20, 2024, 09:30 AM UTC
End Time: February 20, 2024, 12:45 PM UTC
Impact:
The user authentication service was down, resulting in 30% of users unable to log in.
Users experienced prolonged login times and intermittent errors during the outage.
Timeline:

Detection:
Detected at 09:30 AM UTC through a spike in error rates on the monitoring dashboard.
Actions Taken:
09:35 AM UTC: Investigated backend server logs for anomalies.
10:00 AM UTC: Assumed a database issue; focused on database query optimization.
10:45 AM UTC: No improvement; escalated to the database team.
11:15 AM UTC: Database team identified an issue with a misconfigured load balancer.
11:30 AM UTC: Misled by initial assumption; escalated to network infrastructure team.
12:00 PM UTC: Network team identified a DDoS attack; implemented mitigations.
12:45 PM UTC: Service restored after implementing DDoS protections.
Root Cause and Resolution:

Root Cause:
The root cause was identified as a DDoS attack targeting the authentication service.
Attackers exploited a vulnerability in the load balancer configuration, causing a service overload.
Resolution:
Implemented DDoS protection measures on the load balancer.
Updated firewall rules to block malicious traffic.
Conducted a thorough security audit to patch potential vulnerabilities.
Corrective and Preventative Measures:

Improvements/Fixes:
Strengthen load balancer configurations against potential vulnerabilities.
Enhance monitoring capabilities to quickly detect and respond to DDoS attacks.
Conduct regular security audits and penetration testing to identify and patch vulnerabilities.
Tasks:
Task 1: Update load balancer configurations to adhere to security best practices.
Task 2: Implement additional layers of DDoS protection, including rate limiting.
Task 3: Enhance monitoring alerts for faster detection of abnormal patterns.
Task 4: Schedule regular security audits to proactively identify and address vulnerabilities.
This outage served as a valuable learning experience, highlighting the importance of a multi-layered approach to security and the need for continuous monitoring and improvement. The outlined tasks will be prioritized and addressed promptly to ensure the resilience of our web stack against future incidents.
